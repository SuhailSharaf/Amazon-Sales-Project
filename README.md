# Amazon Sales Analysis and Future Sales Prediction

This project involves the analysis of Amazon sales data for the year 2019 and the development of a predictive model to forecast future sales. 
By leveraging historical sales data, this project aims to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing sales on the Amazon platform. 
The predictive model, once trained, can be used to estimate future sales based on relevant features.



## Data
I got the data from Kaggle. The data ranges from January 2019 to January 2020. It has over 186,000 rows,or orders, of data, with a wide range of products.
## Approach
1. Download CSV from Kaggle. 
2. Concatenate all 12 individual files. Wrangle the data so that all NAN values are gone.
3. Exploratory Data analaysis will involve finding out which product sold the most, best month for sales, and what time are most popular for ordering. 
4. Chose models that were the best for this project, which were Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression.  
5. Model the data. 
6. Compare the results, and see where to improve for the future.

## Deliverables
